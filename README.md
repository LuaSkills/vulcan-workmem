# luaskills-demo-skill

A complete demo LuaSkill repository for testing package installation, GitHub release packaging, version updates, uninstall behavior, and one no-op `rg` dependency.

## What this repository demonstrates

- the strict `skill.yaml` package layout
- a required semantic `version` field in `skill.yaml`
- a `dependencies.yaml` file with one skill-local `rg` dependency
- multiple runtime entries under `runtime/`
- help topics under `help/`
- one overflow template under `overflow_templates/`
- one resource file under `resources/`
- GitHub Actions workflows for validation and release packaging
- a tag-driven release workflow that only builds packages after a release tag is pushed

## Skill package layout

```text
luaskills-demo-skill/
├─ skill.yaml
├─ dependencies.yaml
├─ runtime/
├─ help/
├─ overflow_templates/
├─ resources/
├─ licenses/
├─ scripts/
└─ .github/workflows/
```

## Demo tools

- `demo-status`
  - returns stable runtime diagnostics for installation and lifecycle testing
- `rg-check`
  - reports the expected local `rg` dependency path and runs `rg --version` when the file exists
- `overflow-demo`
  - returns paged output and a skill-local overflow template hint

## Demo dependency

The repository declares one skill-local `rg` dependency in `dependencies.yaml`.

The dependency is intentionally non-essential:

- it is useful for testing install and uninstall behavior
- it is safe to skip when network downloads are disabled
- the `rg-check` tool can still return a diagnostic report when `rg` is missing

## Validation

This repository includes one validation workflow and one release workflow.

Local validation:

```powershell
python .\scripts\validate_skill.py
python .\scripts\package_skill.py
```

The packaging script now generates three artifacts under `dist/`:

- `<skill-id>-v<version>-skill.zip`
- `<skill-id>-v<version>-checksums.txt`
- `<skill-id>-v<version>-source.yaml`

The generated `source.yaml` is the URL-install metadata example.
If you do not pass `--base-url`, it uses a placeholder URL that you can edit manually for local or self-hosted tests.

GitHub validation:

- pushes to `main` only run structure validation
- pull requests only run structure validation
- no release package is published from branch pushes

## Tag-based release flow

This repository uses a tag-driven release flow.

Only a pushed tag that matches `v*` triggers package build and GitHub release publication.
The tag must match `skill.yaml.version`.

Recommended local release steps:

```powershell
python .\scripts\validate_skill.py
python .\scripts\package_skill.py
.\scripts\tag_release.ps1 0.1.0
```

Or on Unix-like shells:

```bash
python ./scripts/validate_skill.py
python ./scripts/package_skill.py
./scripts/tag_release.sh 0.1.0
```

The helper scripts normalize the version into a `vX.Y.Z` tag and push it to `origin`.
The packaging script treats `skill.yaml.version` as the release version source of truth and rejects mismatched tag or CLI versions.
If you want the generated source metadata to be immediately usable, you can pass a base URL:

```powershell
python .\scripts\package_skill.py --base-url https://example.com/releases
```

## Release packaging

After the tag is pushed, the release workflow produces:

- `<skill-id>-v<version>-skill.zip`
- `<skill-id>-v<version>-checksums.txt`
- `<skill-id>-v<version>-source.yaml`

The zip file always expands to one top-level directory named exactly:

```text
luaskills-demo-skill/
```

## Notes

- Runtime output is intentionally English-only.
- Code comments inside source files follow the rule: English line first, Chinese line second.
- The repository root itself is the skill root, and the skill id is the directory name.
- The generated `source.yaml` is designed to be reused later for URL-based install flows, self-hosted package endpoints, and future skillhub-compatible metadata responses.
